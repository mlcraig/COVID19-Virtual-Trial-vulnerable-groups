These files accompany the paper "Using virtual patient cohorts to uncover immune response differences in cancer and immunosuppressed COVID-19 patients" by Sonia Gazeau et al. 

The three .mat files each include 280 virtual patients corresponding to the reference, cancer, and immunosuppressed VPCs. Load them in conjunction with the code accompanying the PLOS Pathogens paper titled "COVID-19 virtual patient cohort suggests immune (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009753) available from the GitHub repository: https://github.com/adriannejnner/COVID19-Virtual-Trial-PLOS-Pathogens to simulate COVID-19 trajectories. Also included is a .m Matlab script for generating the correlation plots in the paper.
